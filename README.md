# Submission for Team Abhiyaan

**Name:** Hitesh Pawar

**Roll No:** ME18B161


**Previous Experience:**

Relevant Projects:
- Smartcopter, CVI club | CFI: 
  - A fully autonomous drone enabled with computer vision for navigation in GPS denied environment
  - Experience with custom PX4 Firmware version and simulation with software like MoveIt & Gazebo
  - Navigation algorithms using SLAM combined with DQN RL model for obstacle avoidance.


- Bosch's Traffic sign Recognition problem | Techmeet 2021 : Trasfer learning of Imagenet model on GTSRB dataset


NVIDIA | Research Internship 
- Currently doing a research internship at NVIDIA, Working on a research paper ‘Scene Text Detection and Recognition in the Wild for self-driving cars’
- Along with that, Developing an end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning model for NVIDIA’s Leonardo robot for industrial operations


Few well performed hackathons:
- Fiction2Science India Challenge:
  - Smart Hybrid Autonomous Drive, Built a model of a smart drive for pre-crash safety which enables improved drive quality &
    safety to make driving safe and seamless.
  - Implemented YoloV3 for object detection, lane detection and developed algorithm for crash prediction
  - Performed drowsiness detection of driver along with voice alerts using Python, PyTorch and OpenCV packages
  -  Placed 2nd among the 90 teams nation-wide and received StarIdeatorAward by Continental at Bangalore :p


- Mercedes-Benz Digital Challenge: 
  - Recognition of Thin cross-session Objects- Devised a system for object detection for autonomous vehicles
  - Modified YOLO model with to achieve balanced performance between YOLOv3-spp (mAp-60.6, FPS-20) & YOLOv3-tiny (mAP-33.1, FPS-220)


**Current PORS:** None :)
but about to get one, hopefully :D
(Past PORS: CVI club member, E-Cell Manager, Member of Team Avishkar Hyperloop, Lifestyle contiengent, etc.)


**Why I want to work in the team:**
Yes! I do think that this is the best team for me in the institute right now :D, that's why I have been paining Akash to take me into the team literally from past 9 months, but he gave me no option other than waiting for the official recruitment :X, so here I am!!

On a serious note, Team Abhiyaan is the closest thing in institute to the career path I have choosen, i.e. The Self-Driving cars, and I see it as the best opportunity in the institute to grow and improve my skills, and to learn from all the like minded individuals working towards the same goal. Now don't get me wrong, I am not selfish, I also want to join the team because it has a lot of poytential, and I want to help taking the team on a whole new level (which is already happening I guess, with all the solid ranks in the competitions) but I believe this is a just a begining of the gloary of Team Abhiyaan and this is the place where I can significantly contribute and that contribution will matter! I have also gathered various experiences through my internships, projects, courses and hackathons that I want to put to some good reason and hone my skills in the meantime.

Along with this,  I do want to be a part of a big team again!!! It's been so long and I have almost been a lone wolf for the past one year, the lockdown, but now I want to get back in the game and enjoy some late night worksessions and hopefully get that team treat after coming to the campus :X, and who knows I might aslo be giving the team treat to the new recruits of abhiyaan 2 years down the line :D

**Navigation**

Weather can adversely effect our sensor data, camera sensors face the most impact due to bad weather condition, so for the firsst step we should use more than one sensors to receive data, that we already do, but we aslo should include sensors which are less likely to get effected by these conditions, such as radar, ultrasonic senors, we can also use LIDAR but it's high cost is a negative point for it.

Along with this, we can also use locad 3D map generation along with the gps and IMU sensors, and various collision avoidance techniques to make sure of robots safety. As well as we can train the robot in harsh conditions to make it more robost to these situations, many more solutions are possible, like taking benefit of the surrounding environment to navigate, use more robust sensors, and much more.
